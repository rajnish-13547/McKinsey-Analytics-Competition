# McKinsey-Analytics-Competition
An analytics competition I took part on 22/7/18

McKinsey is consulting a subscription-based media company (e.g. Netflix), say ABC. Company has provided database of its consumers. To increase its revenue, agents are hired, to convince/ encourage customers to upgrade to premium subscription. Based on probability, analysis has to be done to maximise potential revenue =  (probability if above threshold* premium subscription cost) - (agent cost/hr* hours agent spent). Probability is evaluated based on fact how many times a customer has purchased in last 3 mo., last 6 mo., and last 12 mo.. Relation between probability increase and hours spent by agent is also provided by company (by their research).
